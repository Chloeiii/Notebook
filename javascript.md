## Document Object Model (DOM) :smirk:
When a HTML page is loaded by a browser, it is converted to a hierarchical structure. Every tag in HTML is converted to an element / object in the DOM with a parent-child hierarchy. It makes our HTML more logically structured. Once the DOM is formed, it becomes easier to manipulate (add/modify/remove) the elements on the page.

Let us understand the DOM using the following HTML document âˆ’

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang = "en">
       <head>
          <title>My Document</title>
       </head>

       <body>
          <div>
             <h1>Greeting</h1>
             <p>Hello World!</p>
          </div>
       </body>
    </html>

## Array
select elements from an array

    var animals = ['ant', 'bison', 'camel', 'duck', 'elephant'];

    console.log(animals.slice(2));
    // expected output: Array ["camel", "duck", "elephant"]

    console.log(animals.slice(2, 4));
    // expected output: Array ["camel", "duck"]

    console.log(animals.slice(1, 5));
    // expected output: Array ["bison", "camel", "duck", "elephant"]
