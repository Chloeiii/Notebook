## Programming Languages:ghost:
 **C**  
C is one of the older languages still in use, and is the basis for most of the other languages on this list. C is used to develop low-level programs, and works very closely with the computer's hardware.

 **C++**  
This is the object-oriented version of C, and is the most popular programming language in the world. Programs such as Chrome, Firefox, Photoshop, and many others are all built with C++. It is also a very popular language for creating video games. C++ developers are almost always in very high demand.

 **Java**  
This is an evolution of the C++ language, and is used to due its ease of portability. Almost any system can run a Java Virtual Machine, allowing it to run Java software. It is widely used in video games and business software, and many people recommend it as an essential language.

 **C#** 
C# is a Windows-based language that is part of the .NET framework from Microsoft. It is closely related to Java and C++, and if you learn Java you can quickly transition to C#. This language is especially useful for developers working with Windows or Windows Phone software.

**Objective-C** 
This is another cousin of the C language that is specifically designed for Apple systems. It sees immense popularity in iPhone and iPad apps. It is a great language to learn as a freelancer.

**Python** 
This is an incredibly easy language to learn, one of the easiest. Python specializes in web development.

 **PHP**  
This isn't exactly software development, but PHP is essential if you are interested in getting into web development. There is always lots of work for PHP developers, though it isn't as lucrative as software development.

> Java, Python, C++, Visual Basic .NET and Ruby are the most popular OOP languages today. The Java programming language is designed especially for use in distributed applications on corporate networks and the Internet. Ruby is used in many Web applications

## HTTP & HTTPS:nail_care:
HTTP stands for "hypertext transfer protocol", a method of data communication for the Internet. HTTP is an application layer protocol, which means it focus on how information is presented to the user at the computer but doesn't address how data gets from Point A to Point B. Any data transferred with the HTTP protocol can potentially be intercepted and even manipualated by third parties.  

> HTTP: no passoword encryption implemented

HTTPS is an extension of the HTTP protocol that works in conjunction with another protocol, called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to transport data safely. Neither HTTP nor HTTPS address how data gets to its destination. By contrast, SSL doesn't have anything to do with the appearance of the data. 
People often use the terms HTTPS and SSL interchangeably, but this isn't accurate. HTTPS is secure because it uses SSL to move data. As SSL involved, it was replaced by TLS, or Transport Layer Security - an even more secure way of encrypting information.
