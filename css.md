## Position
- static

    is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the **normal flow of the page**
- relative

    positioned **relative to its normal position**.  
    Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
- fixed

    is positioned **relative to the viewport**, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.    
- absolute

    positioned relative to the nearest positioned **ancestor**.   
- sticky

    positioned based on the user's **scroll position**.
